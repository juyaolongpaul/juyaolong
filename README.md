# Introduction

Graduating from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) as a computer science B.S., I achieved M.S. from [Peking University](http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/auditory/auditory.htm), where I was fortunate to engage in the research of music technology, an interdisciplinary field between music and computer science. During my master study, I discovered my passion for research and determined to pursue a doctoral study. 

In 2021, I obtained a Ph.D. degree (music technology) from [Distributed Digital Music Archives & Libraries Lab](http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). My primary research topic is automatic harmonic analysis, and I am generally interested in applied machine learning, music information retrieval, music theory, and digital music libraries. I used to work at [Tencent Music Entertainment](https://www.tencentmusic.com/en-us/) as a Senior Researcher to develop AI music applications for QQ Music (2020-2022), and now I am a principal engineer at Huawei 2012 Laboratory, [Central Media Technology Institute](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1PF411T7Tu/) leading relevant music research/application projects.
